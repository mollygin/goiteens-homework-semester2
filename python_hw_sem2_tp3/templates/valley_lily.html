    <p>Lily of the valley, with its delicate, bell-shaped flowers and sweet fragrance, is a charming and iconic plant. It's often associated with springtime and is beloved for its beauty and fragrance. Despite its lovely appearance, it's worth noting that lily of the valley is also quite toxic if ingested, so it's important to handle it with care, especially around pets and children.</p>
